1. User stories should be verbose enough that the developer knopws exactly what to do
2. User stories should be verbose enough that the devloper can estimate how long it will take
3. You may not get the perfect user story in the first try (probably when you start writing code, some of them will change and reflect points 1 and 2 better)
4. User stories have priorities (which you already know)
5. User stories should not be ambiguous or contain more than one story. Else it's called an epic
6. User stories should reflect a feature such that once implemented you can say "This user story is complete"
7. Feel free to exhaust all the user stories but don't feel pressured to implement them all
8. Prioritization of user stories comes with interaction with client and the fact that some features have to exist before others
